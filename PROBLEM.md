# Technical Assignment: Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation (ROS2 + Gazebo)

As the next step, we would like you to complete a short technical assignment. This will help us evaluate your hands-on skills in ROS2 development.

## Task Overview

### Title
Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation (ROS2 + Gazebo)

### Objective
Your task is to create a simple differential-drive robot in a ROS2 + Gazebo simulation and make it navigate to multiple goals while avoiding obstacles.

## What You Need to Build

### AMR Model
A basic differential-drive robot equipped with:
- LiDAR
- IMU
- Depth Camera

### Gazebo Simulation
A simple world with static and/or dynamic obstacles.

### Navigation
Use the Nav2 stack for goal navigation and obstacle avoidance.

### Goal Sender
A small script or CLI tool to send navigation goals.

### Documentation
- Clear README
- Short demo video

## Deliverables

- A GitHub/GitLab repository with a complete, buildable ROS2 workspace.
- A 2–3 minute video showing the robot successfully reaching at least 3 goals while avoiding obstacles.
- A README explaining setup, build steps, and execution instructions.

## Timeline Requirement (36 Hours)

You have 40 hours to complete this assessment.

Your submission must include a simple timeline of your work, for example:

- Task 1 – 3 hrs: Developed script for sending goals
- Task 2 – 2 hrs: Created URDF model
- Task 3 – 4 hrs: Nav2 configuration

If you face any delays, please mention:
- The reason for the delay
- Corrective actions taken

## Additional Notes

- You may use ROS2 Humble or Jazzy (your choice).
- Use any other tools/configurations you feel are needed.

Looking forward to seeing your submission.
